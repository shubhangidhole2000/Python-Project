# Python-Project
This project uses Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze and visualize bank loan application data for better portfolio management and decision-making.
## End-to-End Bank Loan Analysis and KPI Monitoring System (Python Project)

## Overview
This project analyzes bank loan applications, disbursals, and repayments to provide actionable insights into loan performance, borrower quality, and funding trends.  
It calculates KPIs, evaluates good vs bad loans, and visualizes trends over time, across states, employment lengths, loan purposes, and home ownership.

## Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas & numpy (data manipulation)
- matplotlib & seaborn (static visualization)
- plotly (interactive visualization)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Imported loan dataset from Excel (`financial_loan.xlsx`).
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handled nulls, converted date columns to datetime, standardized categorical values.
3. **KPI Calculation:** Computed total and MTD loan applications, funded amounts, received amounts, interest rates, and DTI ratios.
4. **Good vs Bad Loan Analysis:** Segregated loans by status to evaluate portfolio quality.
5. **Visualizations:** Built line, bar, pie/donut, horizontal bar, and treemap charts for management insights.

## Key Insights
- **Highest Funded Month:** Latest month recorded maximum funded loans.
- **Top States:** Certain states have the highest loan disbursals.
- **Good Loan Portfolio:** Majority of loans are Fully Paid or Current, indicating low default risk.
- **Popular Loan Terms:** 36-month and 60-month loans dominate the portfolio.
- **Employment & Purpose Trends:** Loans for debt consolidation and home improvement are most common, and applicants with stable employment have higher funded amounts.
